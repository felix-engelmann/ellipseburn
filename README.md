# Ellipse Burn

This tool is useful if you use a laser cutter with an elliptical focus point.
Many CAM tools support a burn/kerf value for a circular correction of cutting width.
However this is not precise if the correction needs to be direction dependent.
Therefore I created this small tool to cut the amazing boxes from https://www.festi.info/boxes.py/
with tight tolerances on all finger joints.

## Example

The green line shows the toolpath for a focus which is stretched in the y direction.
